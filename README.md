-   Assignment: PROJECT 2 Astroids

## Description

This is a 2D game built from scratch in Unity. It is a replication of the popular game Asteroids.

## User Responsibilities

The user will need to use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot.

## Above and Beyond <kbd>OPTIONAL</kbd>

I added a invincibility timer so that when an asteroid hits the spaceship, it will have time to get clear of the asteroid and not be penalized again for the same asteroid.

## Known Issues

No known issues.

## Requirements not completed

I did not fufill the points system, the bullets hitting the asteroids, and the asteroids splitting up after being hit.

## Sources

https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-zvdhq - is the asteroid png that I used for my sprites

## Notes

If a student chooses to use a grace period on a project, it must be included inside that projectâ€™s documentation file.
